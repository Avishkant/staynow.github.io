    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">KRISHNAPURA CHHATRI</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">Another important historical place to visit in Indore is the Krishna Pura Chhatris, which comprises of three chhatris or cenotaphs. These structures house the remains of the deceased members of the Holkar Dynasty and hence are also called the Holkar Chaatris. Built in the 19th century over the place where these rulers were cremated, the place is named after Krishna Bhai Holkar, who was the wife of the famous military leader Yashwantrao Holkar.

            Located on the banks of the River Khan or Kahn, these chhatris are a made of stones and also feature statues of soldiers, elaborate carvings of gods and goddesses on the exteriors, and a Krishna temple built for Maharani Krishna Bhai. Krishna Pura Chhatris are located a short walk away from Rajwada Palace, so you can cover both these monuments in one go.</h4>

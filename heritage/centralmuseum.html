    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">CENTRAL MUSEUM</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">The Central Museum, also known as Indore Museum, is where you can travel back in time and learn a thing or two about the region’s rich past. But that’s not all. The building also serves as one of the major historical places in Indore.

            The museum was established during the colonial period, back in 1929, and features a fine collection of prehistoric objects, relics, coins, Parmar scriptures, medieval and pre-medieval Jain and Hindu scriptures, arms and armors, and others. A must-visit place for history buffs, it is one of the best museums in Indore.</h4>

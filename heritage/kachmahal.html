    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">KANCH MANDIR</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">Kanch Mandir aka the Temple of Glass is not just a religious place, but also one of the top historical places to visit in Indore. This famous Jain temple, built around 1903, boasts of a history of over 100 years. The place was constructed by Shri Seth Hukam Chand, who was an industrial pioneer and renowned leader of the Jain community.

            The exteriors of the temple look like a medieval mansion and feature a shikhara and a canopied balcony. The interiors, however, are fully decorated with mirrors, Chinese glass lamps, and glass panels. And thatâ€™s where the temple gets its name from. The structure of the temple and its ornamentation feature medieval and old Jain style. The temple also has the idols of the Thirthankaras installed inside it, with mirrors placed on both sides. </h4>

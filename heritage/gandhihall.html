    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">GANDHI HALL</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">When you make a list of places to visit in Indore, don’t forget to include the Gandhi Hall, the most prominent historical building in the city. Built in 1904, the building features the Indo-Gothic style of architecture. The clock tower, minarets, and domes of the structure add to its grand appeal.

            The building was initially named King Edward Hall and was renamed as Gandhi Hall shortly after India’s independence. Currently, it serves as the town hall of Indore and many cultural and art exhibitions are held here.</h4>

                    Trivia: Guess who inaugurated the Gandhi Hall back in 1905? None other than George V, the then Prince of Wales!

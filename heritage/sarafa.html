    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">SARAFA BAZAR</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">At 8 pm when the jewellery shops shut and you think the day is coming to an end, a new world wakes up at Sarafa Bazaar. A favourite among locals, no trip to Indore is complete without a visit here. Aside from the finger-licking food, it is the chitter-chatter and a peek into the Indore way of life that gives you memories of a lifetime. Among the dishes you must try, the ones that top the list are Bhutte Ka Kis, crispy pakoras and Sitafal Kulfi. Reasonably priced and worth every bite, you won’t be disappointed to spend your night here. The market is open till the wee hours of the morning though it’s best to come early to get the best of the delicious treats.</h4>

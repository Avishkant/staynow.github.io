    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">LALBAGH PALACE</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">Another one of the prominent historical places in Indore is the Lal Bagh Palace, a grand building which once served as the residence of the Holkar rulers. Built in 1886-1921 by Maharaja Shivaji Rao, this beautiful three-storied edifice is located on the banks of Khan River. The building features a grand entrance, a garden of roses, regal artwork by Indian and Italian artists, and an exquisite ballroom. The ornate décor and interiors of Lal Bagh Palace, complete with beautiful wall carvings, chandeliers, rich carpets, and marble floors, will leave you awestruck.

            Today, the palace is converted into a museum where you can see an interesting range of artifacts. Needless to say, a visit to this magnificent palace which spreads over 28 acres is one of the best things do in Indore.</h4>

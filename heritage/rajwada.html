    <strong style="margin-left: 40%;">RAJWADA PALACE</strong>
         <h4 style="margin: 80px;">Built in the year 1766 by the rulers of the Holkar Dynasty, the grand Rajwada Palace is one of the top places to visit in Indore. This seven-storied palace, which exhibits a mix of Maratha, French, and Mughal architectural styles, is a fine example of royal splendor. The entrance of the palace features a grand archway and a huge wooden gate complete with iron studs. The main building comprises a courtyard, ornate balconies and windows, jharokas, elaborately carved wooden jalis, corridors, and galleried rooms.

            An interesting feature of Rajwada Palace is that its top floors are made of wood while the lower three floors are carved out of stone. The palace is now a property maintained by the State Archeology Department which also runs a small souvenir shop within the building. The light and sound show held here in the evenings is a major attraction for visitors.</h4>

                    Trivia: The palace has been damaged by fire and rebuilt not just once or twice, but three times in the last 250 years.
